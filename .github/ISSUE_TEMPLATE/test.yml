        Hey there, **please leave `Task: [Single-Email] -` as part of the title. You can add your custom title after the `-`** this will guarantee that your issue shows up on our project board :rocket:

        Well, now that we covered the important part about the title let me introduce myself...I am the MOPs bot! In this repo we use ChatOps to streamline our communication and run development and operations functions. Because of that you will see me around a lot! Don't be a stranger :wink:

        Please go ahead and fill out the basic information needed for a Single Email below then hit `Submit new issue` and I'll be back with next steps.
