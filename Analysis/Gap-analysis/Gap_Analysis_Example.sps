*** Step 1 - Identifying the cost of essential needs.
* A MEB is already available in the dataset, expressed in per capita monthly term, and differentiated by groups of household size to account for household economies of scale.



*** Step 2 - Computing the household economic capacity.
* The computation of the household economic capacity should follow the methodology used for the ECMEN indicator (version excluding assistance).

	** Sum food expenditures, value of consumed food from own-production, and non-food expenditures.
	COMPUTE PCExp_ECMEN=SUM.1(PC_HHExp_Food_Purch_MN_1M, PC_HHExp_Food_Own_MN_1M, 
                        PC_HHExpNFTotal_Purch_MN_1M). /* at least an argument must be non-missing.
                        VARIABLE LABELS  PCExp_ECMEN 'Household Economic Capacity per capita - monthly'.
                        EXECUTE. 

	** Deduct the value of cash assistance received from WFP and partner humanitarian organizations.
                        RECODE PC_HHAsstCBTRec_Cons_1M (SYSMIS=0).  /* code missing assistance as zero.
                        COMPUTE PCExp_ECMEN = PCExp_ECMEN-PC_HHAsstCBTRec_Cons_1M.
                         IF (PCExp_ECMEN<0) PCExp_ECMEN=0.  /* set negative values to zero.
                        EXECUTE.

*** Step 3 - Identifying the gap analysis cohort.
* In this example the gap analysis group is made of the households with economic capacity below the MEB and who are moderately or severely food insecure based on CARI.

	** create a variable to identify the cohort.
	COMPUTE Gap_ref = (PCExp_ECMEN<MEB AND (CARI_ECMEN=3 OR CARI_ECMEN=4)).
	VARIABLE LABELS Gap_ref  'Gap analysis cohort (below MEB and food insecure)'.
	VALUE LABELS  Gap_ref 1 'Part of cohort'  0 'Not part of cohort'.
	EXECUTE.


*** Step 4 - Estimating the gap.

	** Compute per capita gap for each household.
                        IF (PCExp_ECMEN<MEB) 	PCGap= MEB - PCExp_ECMEN. /* the gap is defined only for hh with economic capacity below the MEB.
	VARIABLE LABELS PCGap 'Gap, per capita, monthly'.
                        EXECUTE.

	** Compute average gap for the gap analysis cohort and save to a variable.
                            AGGREGATE

                              IF (Gap_ref = 0)  PCGap_avg = $sysmis. /* avg gap defined only for the cohort.
                              EXECUTE.


	** Express the average gap as share of the (average) MEB.
                              /* First we need to calculate the average MEB for the reference cohort. Reminder: in this example the MEB is differentiated by groups of household size - if this is not the case this passage is not needed.

*  Estimate the gap by household size
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

* In this dataset different MEB values are provided for 4 categories of household size, to take into account household economies of scale: small (1-3), medium (4-6), large (7-9), extra-large (10+). Accordingly, different gaps will be estimated.

	** Create a variable representing the different categories of household size.
	RECODE hhsize (SYSMIS=SYSMIS) (1 thru 3=1) (4 thru 6=2) (7 thru 9=3) (ELSE=4)  INTO hhsize_cat.
                        VARIABLE LABELS hhsize_cat  'Classes of household size'.

                        EXECUTE.


	** Compute the average gap for household size cat and save into a variable.
                        FILTER BY Gap_ref. /* work only on gap analysis cohort.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*  Compare the gap with and without assistance
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* See Box 3 in the guidance note.
* The gap without assistance has already been computed in the previous section. Now the objective is repeating the procedure but using a version of the household economic capacity "including assistance".

*** Step 1 - Identifying the cost of essential needs.
* Same as in previous section.



*** Step 2 - Computing the household economic capacity .
* The computation of the household economic capacity should follow the methodology used for the ECMEN indicator (version including assistance).

	** Sum food expenditures, value of food consumed from in-kind assistance and gifts, value of consumed food from own-production, non-food expenditures, and the value of non-food from in-kind assistance and gifts.

	** create a variable to identify the cohort.
