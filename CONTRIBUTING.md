# Welcome contributors to the project: 
Thank you so much for your interest in contributing! Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for maintainers to make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved. ðŸ’š

# How to report a bug or request an ehancement
Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.

# How to submit changes
1. Picking a task from the Project board or from the Issues. The tasks displayed in the board have been created and prioritized by the project members and admins.
2. Fork the repository
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
4. Make your changes in a new branch
6. Push the changes to your forked repository. Write clear, concise commit message(s) using conventional-changelog format.
7. Create a Pull Request. 

8. Keep patience for the project maintainer to review and merge the PR

<!-- # Templates
in this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs tidy and relevant. -->

<!-- # Recognition model
Provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project. -->

# Who is involved?
Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a humans.txt file in your root directory (same place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here is an example of a humans.txt file.

# Where can I ask for help? 
A nice extension to the previous section, with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
