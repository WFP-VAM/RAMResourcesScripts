# How to report a bug or request an ehancement
Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.

# How to submit changes
Pull Request protocol etc. You might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission, or any caveats about the speed of response.

<!-- How to test the project, where the tests are located in your directories. -->

# Environment details
How to set up your development environment. This might exist in the README.md depending on the project. If so, include a link.

<!-- # Templates
in this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs tidy and relevant. -->



# Recognition model
Provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project.

# Who is involved?
Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a humans.txt file in your root directory (same place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here is an example of a humans.txt file.

# Where can I ask for help? 
A nice extension to the previous section, with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
