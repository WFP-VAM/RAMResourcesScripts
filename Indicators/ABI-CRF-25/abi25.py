#                    Calculating Asset-Based Indicator (ABI) 25
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# This script calculates the Asset-Based Indicator (ABI) based on various 
# asset-related questions. It recodes the responses, sums the scores, and 
# calculates the percentage ABI for each respondent.
