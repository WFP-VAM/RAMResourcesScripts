/*
The RCS is calculated from 9 sub-statements using a five-point Likert scale (ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree') to capture the household perception of existing resilience capacities or livelihood capital. 
The Resilience Capacity Score aggregates the unweighted answers to the nine statements and is normalized to provide a score ranging from 0 to 100. 
This result is used to classify households in three groups (low, medium, or high). The percentages at each level are used later in following the changes over time in these percentages for a specific target group of households. 
Progress achieved or change over time in any of the 9 items is also calculated to understand which capacities or capitals contribute the most to the final score and which need to be reinforced to enhance future climate resilience. */

** 	Standardizing the score. ***************************************************
/*
Once answers to each of the statements have been gathered, they are numerically converted (Strongly agree = 1, Agree=2, Neutral =3, Disagree=4, Strongly disagree = 5). Individual answers are then used to compute an overall resilience score for each household as an equally weighted average of the nine answers.

The resilience score is standardized by minmax normalization , transforming the results in a score that ranges from 0 (not at all resilient) to 100 (fully resilient).

/*
Once the RCS is calculated, households are divided in terciles (low-medium-high) to show the distribution of the RCS within the target population. Therefore:
	 if RCS<33 the household is categorized as reporting a low RCS,
	 if 33=<RCS<66 the household is categorized as reporting a medium RCS and
	 if RCS>=66 then the household is categorized as reporting a high RCS.

As each figure represents the percentage of households at each level, the sum of each row must be 100% in all cases. 
	Individual statement score calculation:

The calculation of the average score for each statement is recommended for use in the narrative and in the further analysis of elements with higher incidence in the RCS calculation and/or for picking out the major variations over time of the elements of the score. 

Therefore, using answers coded as values from 1 to 5, the sum of all values for each statement(S), divided by the sample size (n) will yield 9 values (one for each Q) that could be compared over time and used as shown in the visualization section.
