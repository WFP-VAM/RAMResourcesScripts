This folder contains all standardized scripts for indicators, analysis and visualization. The folders are organized as follows:

- **Analysis:** Plots, cross-tabulations, output tables...etc.
- **Indicators**: Plain indicator calculations
- **Logical Cleaning**: Removing and replacing values that are outside logical boundaries for the specific data points (e.g.: negative expenditures, Food Consumption > 7,…)
- **Statistical Cleaning:** cleaning and replacing missing values based on analysis of the statistical distributions (e.g.: expenditures above the 99th percentile of the distribution,… )
- **Static:** Sample files that can be used for testing all of the above
